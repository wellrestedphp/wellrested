Handlers and Middleware
=======================

WellRESTed allows you to define and use your handlers and middleware in a number of ways.

Defining Handlers and Middleware
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

PSR-15 Interfaces
-----------------

The preferred method is to use the interfaces standardized by PSR-15_. This standard includes two interfaces, ``Psr\Http\Server\RequestHandlerInterface`` and ``Psr\Http\Server\MiddlewareInterface``.

Use ``RequestHandlerInterface`` for individual components that generate and return responses.

.. code-block:: php

    class HelloHandler implements RequestHandlerInterface
    {
        public function handle(ServerRequestInterface $request): ResponseInterface
        {
            // Check for a "name" attribute which may have been provided as a
            // path variable. Use "world" as a default.
            $name = $request->getAttribute("name", "world");

            // Set the response body to the greeting and the status code to 200 OK.
            $response = (new Response(200))
                ->withHeader("Content-type", "text/plain")
                ->withBody(new Stream("Hello, $name!"));

            // Return the response.
            return $response;
        }
    }

Use ``MiddlewareInterface`` for classes that interact with other middleware and handlers. For example, you may have middleware that attempts to retrieve a cached response and delegates to other handlers on a cache miss.

.. code-block:: php

    class CacheMiddleware implements MiddlewareInterface
    {
        public function process(
            ServerRequestInterface $request,
            RequestHandlerInterface $handler
        ): ResponseInterface
        {

            // Inspect the request to see if there is a representation on hand.
            $representation = $this->getCachedRepresentation($request);
            if ($representation !== null) {
                // There is already a cached representation.
                // Return it without delegating to the next handler.
                return (new Response())
                    ->withStatus(200)
                    ->withBody($representation);
            }

            // No representation exists. Delegate to the next handler.
            $response = $handler->handle($request);

            // Attempt to store the response to the cache.
            $this->storeRepresentationToCache($response);

            return $response
        }

        private function getCachedRepresentation(ServerRequestInterface $request)
        {
            // Look for a cached representation. Return null if not found.
            // ...
        }

        private function storeRepresentationToCache(ResponseInterface $response)
        {
            // Ensure the response contains a success code, a valid body,
            // headers that allow caching, etc. and store the representation.
            // ...
        }
    }

Legacy Middleware Interface
---------------------------

Prior to PSR-15, WellRESTed's recommended handler interface was ``WellRESTed\MiddlewareInterface``. This interface is still supported for backwards compatibility.

This interface serves for both handlers and middleware. It differs from the ``Psr\Http\Server\MiddlewareInterface`` in that is expects an incoming ``$response`` parameter which you may use to generate the returned response. It also expected a ``$next`` parameter which is a ``callable`` with this signature:

.. code-block:: php

    function next($request, $response): ResponseInterface

Call ``$next`` and pass ``$request`` and ``$response`` to forward the request to the next handler. ``$next`` will return the response from the handler. Here's the cache example above as a ``WellRESTed\MiddlewareInterface``.

.. code-block:: php

    class CacheMiddleware implements WellRESTed\MiddlewareInterface
    {
        public function __invoke(
            ServerRequestInterface $request,
            ResponseInterface $response,
            $next
        ) {

            // Inspect the request to see if there is a representation on hand.
            $representation = $this->getCachedRepresentation($request);
            if ($representation !== null) {
                // There is already a cached representation.
                // Return it without delegating to the next handler.
                return $response
                    ->withStatus(200)
                    ->withBody($representation);
            }

            // No representation exists. Delegate to the next handler.
            $response = $next($request, $response);

            // Attempt to store the response to the cache.
            $this->storeRepresentationToCache($response);

            return $response
        }

        private function getCachedRepresentation(ServerRequestInterface $request)
        {
            // Look for a cached representation. Return null if not found.
            // ...
        }

        private function storeRepresentationToCache(ResponseInterface $response)
        {
            // Ensure the response contains a success code, a valid body,
            // headers that allow caching, etc. and store the representation.
            // ...
        }
    }

Callables
---------

You may also use a ``callable`` similar to the legacy ``WellRESTed\MiddlewareInterface``. The signature of the callable matches the signature of ``WellRESTed\MiddlewareInterface::__invoke``.

.. code-block:: php

    $handler = function ($request, $response, $next) {

        // Delegate to the next handler.
        $response = $next($request, $response);

        return $response
            ->withHeader("Content-type", "text/plain")
            ->withBody(new Stream("Hello, $name!"));
    }

Using Handlers and Middleware
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Methods that accept handlers and middleware (e.g., ``Server::add``, ``Router::register``) allow you to provide them in a number of ways. For example, you can provide an instance, a ``callable`` that returns an instance, or an ``array`` of middleware to use in sequence. The following examples will demonstrate all of the ways you can register handlers and middleware.

Dependency Service Name (Recommended)
-------------------------------------

If you're using a PSR-11_ `dependency injection`_ container, register the service name, and WellRESTed will retrieve the service. The advantage of this approach is that no handlers (and their dependencies) are instantiated until they are needed.

.. code-block:: php

    $container['WidgetHandler'] = fn($c) => new WidgetHandler();

    $router->register("GET,PUT,DELETE", "/widgets/{id}", "WidgetHandler");

Factory Functions
-----------------

Prior to v6, using a function that returns an instance of your handler was the best approach. You can still use this if you're using a DI container that does not conform to PSR-11_.

.. code-block:: php

    $router->register("GET,PUT,DELETE", "/widgets/{id}",
        function () { return new App\WidgetHandler(); }
    );

Instance
--------

WellRESTed also allows you to pass an instance of a handler directly. This may be useful for smaller handlers that don't require many dependencies, although registering by service name or factory function is better in most cases.

.. code-block:: php

    $widgetHandler = new WidgetHandler();

    $router->register("GET,PUT,DELETE", "/widgets/{id}", $widgetHandler);

.. warning::

    This is simple, but has a significant disadvantage over the other options because each handler used this way will be loaded and instantiated, even if it's not needed to handler the current request. You may find this approach useful for testing, but avoid if for production code.

Fully Qualified Class Name (FQCN)
---------------------------------

For handlers that do not require any arguments passed to the constructor, you may pass the fully qualified class name of your handler as a ``string``. You can do that like this:

.. code-block:: php

    $router->register('GET,PUT,DELETE', '/widgets/{id}', App\WidgetHandler::class);
    // ... or ...
    $router->register('GET,PUT,DELETE', '/widgets/{id}', 'App\\WidgetHandler');

The class is not loaded, and no instances are created, until the route is matched and dispatched. However, the drawback to this approach is the there is no way to pass any arguments to the constructor.

Array
-----

The final approach is to provide a sequence of middleware and a handler as an ``array``.

For example, imagine if we had a Pimple_ container with these services:

.. code-block:: php

    $c['authMiddleware'] // Ensures the user is logged in
    $c['cacheMiddleware'] // Provides a cached response if able
    $c['widgetHandler']  // Provides a widget representation

We could provide these as a sequence by using an ``array``.

.. code-block:: php

    $router->register('GET', '/widgets/{id}', [
        $c['authMiddleware'],
        $c['cacheMiddleware'],
        $c['widgetHandler']
    ]);
