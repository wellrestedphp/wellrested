WellRESTed
==========

WellRESTed is a library for creating RESTful APIs and websites in PHP that provides abstraction for HTTP messages, a powerful handler and middleware system, and a flexible router.

Features
--------

PSR-7 HTTP Messages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Request and response messages are built to the interfaces standardized by PSR-7_ making it easy to share code and use components from other libraries and frameworks.

The message abstractions facilitate working with message headers, status codes, variables extracted from the path, message bodies, and all the other aspects of requests and responses.

PSR-15 Handler Interfaces
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

WellRESTed can use handlers and middleware using the interfaces defined by the PSR-15_ standard.

PSR-11 Dependency Container
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

New in version 6, WellRESTed can integrate with any dependency injection container implementing the PSR-11_ standard such as `PHP DI`_.

Router
^^^^^^

The router_ allows you to define your endpoints using `URI Templates`_ like ``/foo/{bar}/{baz}`` that match patterns of paths and provide captured variables. You can also match exact paths for extra speed or regular expressions for extra flexibility.

WellRESTed's router automates responding to ``OPTIONS`` requests for each endpoint based on the methods you assign. ``405 Method Not Allowed`` responses come free of charge as well for any methods you have not implemented on a given endpoint.

Middleware
^^^^^^^^^^

The middleware_ system allows you to build your Web service out of discrete, modular pieces. These pieces can be run in sequences where each has an opportunity to work with the request before handing it off to the next. For example, an authenticator can validate a request and forward it to a cache; the cache can check for a stored representation and forward to another middleware if no cached representation is found, etc. All of this happens without any one middleware needing to know anything about where it is in the chain or which middleware comes before or after.

Lazy Loading
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Handlers and middleware can be registered with a PSR-11_ dependency container or as `factory functions`_ so that they are only instantiated if needed. This way, a Web service with hundreds of handlers and middleware only creates instances required for the current request-response cycle.

Extensible
^^^^^^^^^^

Most classes are coded to interfaces to allow you to provide your own implementations and use them in place of the built-in classes. For example, if your Web service needs to be able to dispatch middleware that implements a third-party interface, you can provide your own custom ``DispatcherInterface`` implementation.

Example
-------

Here's a customary "Hello, world!" example. This site will respond to requests for ``GET /hello`` with "Hello, world!" and provide custom responses for other paths (e.g., ``GET /hello/Molly`` will respond "Hello, Molly!").

The site will also provide an ``X-example: hello world`` using dedicated middleware, just to illustrate how middleware propagates.

    // Read the request from the client, dispatch, and output.
